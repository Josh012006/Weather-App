## Hello there

This is a simple Weather App in HTML, CSS and JS. This is one of my firsts real projects that I'm really proud of.
It not only shows that I have great foundations in the basics but also that I've made a certain improvement since my debuts.


So give it a try.

## About the project

I used two APIs in my project. One that gives me the country code needed for the second API, which gives me the weather and information based on the name of the city and the country.
The weather API requires a key to work, but don't worry, the one I used is free. So anyone who downloads will be able to access the info.

## âš  NB: You'll be able to search for specific countries. For the application to work, please search in English (country and city) and be as specific as possible. 
For example, instead of United States, write United States of America. 
## And avoid special characters if possible.

## You can use the app as long as you respect this. Good luck!
